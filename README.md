Next js
We took our project to the next level by building it with Next.js, a powerful framework for React applications. With Next.js, we got all the goodies of server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), making our app lightning fast and optimized for search engines. Next.js also provided us with automatic code splitting, so our pages load in a flash. And the best part? We could easily set up API routes for seamless backend functionality without the hassle of managing a separate server. By leveraging the capabilities of Next.js, we created a robust and efficient project that delivers an exceptional user experience.

Tailwind
This project embraces the power and flexibility of Tailwind CSS, a cutting-edge utility-first CSS framework. With Tailwind CSS, we get access to a massive collection of utility classes that make styling a breeze. By adopting a utility-first approach, we can quickly mix and match these classes right in our HTML markup. This not only speeds up the development process but also allows us to easily maintain and scale our codebase.
